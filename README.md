# Typeahead-Suggestion System
🚀 A real-time, high-performance Typeahead Suggestion System built using microservices architecture. It leverages Trie data structures, Redis caching, and a distributed indexing system to provide fast and intelligent search suggestions.

**Features**
🔍 Real-time Suggestions – Fetch top search suggestions within 200ms
⚡ High-performance Trie Implementation – Efficient in-memory storage for prefix-based search
🏎️ Redis Caching – Faster access to frequently searched terms
🗄️ Distributed Indexing Service – Periodic batch updates to keep search terms fresh
📊 Personalized Suggestions – User-specific recommendations based on search history
🔄 Scalable Microservices Architecture – Built with Spring Boot, Redis, Kafka, and MySQL
🛠️ Deployed with Docker & Kubernetes


**Tech Stack**
Backend: Spring Boot, Java, Redis, Kafka, MySQL
Architecture: Microservices, API Gateway (Spring Cloud), Load Balancer
Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)


**Roadmap**
✅ Implement Trie-based Search Service
✅ Add Redis Caching for Faster Lookups
✅ Introduce Search Indexing via Kafka & Batch Processing
🚧 Personalization Engine for Context-aware Suggestions
🚧 Machine Learning-based Ranking Algorithm
